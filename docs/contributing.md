## How to Help
Slowduino welcomes pull requests and issue reports. You can contribute in several ways:
- Test the firmware on a Speeduino v0.4 board or Uno/Nano and report discrepancies.
- Improve documentation, fix typos, or add tutorials for newcomers.
- Submit bug fixes or performance optimizations.
- Add simulator tests or helper scripts for calibration.

## Communication
Open an issue for questions, suggestions, or to share your build. The project thrives on real-world feedback from the community.
